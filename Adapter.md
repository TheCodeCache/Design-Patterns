# Adapter Design Pattern â€“ 

It's a construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface  

Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate with each other  

It uses `inheritance` and `composition` to enable objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate with one another  

**Implementation:**  

Suppose we've MultiRestoApp that works only with XML Data as follows:

This app is being used by UI app that works only with JSON data as follows:

Since they two work with different represenations of data, hence they can not work with each other.  
To solve this issue, we can use `Adapter Pattern` to allow the collaboration b/w these two possible
