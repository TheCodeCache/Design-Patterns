# Strategy Design Pattern â€“ 

Thought process - 

"Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher and lower level parts.

For ex: let us consider the process of making a tea.

so, the process of making a tea can be decomposed into something high level,  
like the process of making hot beverages (boil water, pour into cup)  
and it doesn't matter whether we're making tea or coffee or any other hot drink,  
we've to boil the water and we've to pour the water into a cup  
so, this is the high level part.  

and then we've the tea specific things. so after we've done the high level stuffs,  
what we can do is, we can take a tea bag put it into water, we can add milk or sugar oe lemon etc.  

so, the high level algorithm (the process of boiling water, pouring into cup) can then be reused.
