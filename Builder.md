# Builder Design Pattern â€“ 

It lets us create a complex object on step-by-step basis  

**Problem:**  
Consider a Car class, which has a long list of attriutes.  

and assume, Not all the attributes are mandatory while instantiating the Car class.

There are 2 ways to approach towards creating the instance of this class.  

**Case-1:** Create a single constructor using all the attributes  
and then create instances like this -

**Case-2:** Create all possible constructors from the combination of the attributes  
and then create instances like this -

Well, there's problem in both of the above approaches,  
in first case, it doe not work well with optional attributes, we still need to supply null in the right position (which is an overhead)  
in 2nd case, we would end up having a large number of constructors (difficult to maintain)  

This is where, Builder Pattern helps us
